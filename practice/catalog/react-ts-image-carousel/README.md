# React + TypeScript: Image Carousel

Collection: catalog · ID: `react-ts-image-carousel` · Mode: **react**

## Business context

Build and verify the core behavior behind Image Carousel. This independently authored exercise has a bounded, explicit contract. Injected clock, network, random, or worker models are identified in the contract; they do not claim production service guarantees.

## Task

Export App({items=[Alpha,Beta,Gamma]}), a image carousel using title strings and local one-pixel images with alt=title. slides container [data-testid=slides] contains one articles with h2 titles. Next/Previous use data-action=next/previous. Navigation wraps. Empty items renders No images.  This exercise focuses selection/window semantics rather than remote image loading.

TypeScript contract: export default App and export AppProps. Use strict TSX with typed props, state, event handlers, refs and domain records. The compiler rejects implicit/explicit any and suppression directives before DOM tests or preview. Only react and react/jsx-runtime imports are supported.

## Candidate tasks

- Implement the documented behavior without hard-coding fixture answers.
- Run the full suite, investigate boundary failures, and explain the follow-up variation.
- Model the component data and narrow nullable refs and unknown errors without disabling type checking.

## Constraints

- Export default App. Only react and react/jsx-runtime imports are supported. The DOM contract and supplied props define the exercise.
- Preserve identity, ordering, boundary behavior, and error messages stated in the contract. Passing fixtures verifies this contract, not every production concern.
- Keep the supplied AppProps contract and type-safe state transitions. A passing submission must type-check and pass the original DOM journeys.

## Follow-up questions

- Pause autoplay on interaction/focus and resume only under an explicit user-controlled policy.
