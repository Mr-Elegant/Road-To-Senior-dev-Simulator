# Build an actionable Next.js latency and reliability SLO

Collection: catalog · ID: `next-lab-observability-slo` · Mode: **guided**

## Business context

The only metric is next build duration, yet users report slow navigation and intermittent action failures.

## Task

Design the system for p95 route interaction under 1 second; 99.9% successful authenticated operations. Produce the component/data-flow diagram, request and mutation contracts, cache/trust boundaries, capacity assumptions, failure recovery and rollout gates. State which decisions change between Next.js 15 and 16 instead of using a framework API as a substitute for an architectural guarantee.

## Candidate tasks

- Draw components and annotate ownership of data, identity, caches and durable work.
- Specify contracts/schema and quantify the capacity/freshness assumptions.
- Walk through the failure scenario and design measurable acceptance tests.
- Compare the reference decisions and answer the changed-requirement interview prompt.

## Constraints

- Measure user-visible and server dependency boundaries.
- Separate cold/warm and direct/soft navigation.
- Link alerts to operational response.

## Follow-up questions

- Would more telemetry always improve diagnosis?

## Work locally

Edit [answer.md](answer.md). Keep the original function names and input/output contracts.

This is a guided exercise. Review your answer against the rubric and reference; no automated correctness score is claimed. If code is supplied, edit and run it with the appropriate local tooling and add your own tests.

Full authored task data (including review files, telemetry, stages, requirements, hints, and examples where supplied) is in [exercise.json](exercise.json).

After your attempt, open [reference.md](reference.md) for the authored answer, rubric, follow-ups, and solution.

## Next.js version and verification scope

Mode: **architecture**.

Next.js 15: Use patched Next.js 15 and the router family named by the file path. Await request APIs where the App Router contract requires it; validate behavior in a production build.

Next.js 16: Applies to Next.js 16.4.5. Cache Components is disabled unless the exercise explicitly enables it. The simulator itself remains on 16.4.3.

### Acceptance evidence

- Inject latency separately into auth, database and client code.
- Confirm an alert points to useful diagnostic evidence and a bounded mitigation.
- Compare cold/warm and direct/client navigation measurements without combining unlike events.

Framework reviews and architecture work need real-server/manual evidence, not a manufactured browser test pass.
